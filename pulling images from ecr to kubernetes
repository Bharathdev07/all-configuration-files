Step 1: Get ECR login password:--
In the prerequisite section, we ran a command to authenticate with AWS ECR. Use the first part of that command to get the ECR login password

$ aws ecr get-login-password --region <region_name>
Step 2: Create kubectl secret:-
Next, we will create a kubectl secret using the password we received in the previous section. Run the following command to create a secret.

$ kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred \
--docker-server=<registry url> \
--docker-username=AWS \
--docker-password=<password from last step> \
--docker-email=<AWS account email ID>

Replace the following values:--

<registry url> with the registry URL. It will be of the following form. Refer to the link in the prerequisites for steps on obtaining the account ID.
<aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com
<password from last step> that you received in the last step
<AWS account email ID> with the email ID for your AWS account.
